# GrainEngine
A Granular Synthesizer written using C++ and the JUCE framework.

Based on Ross Bencina's [article](http://www.rossbencina.com/static/code/granular-synthesis/BencinaAudioAnecdotes310801.pdf) on Real-Time granular synthesis processing. Currently the synthesizer is using files provided by the user and is constantly playing (the user changes the parameters of the synth to change its timbre).

Example(song attributed to Radiohead):
