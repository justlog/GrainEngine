# GrainEngine
## What is this?
A Granular Synthesizer written using C++ and the JUCE framework.

Based on Ross Bencina's [article](http://www.rossbencina.com/static/code/granular-synthesis/BencinaAudioAnecdotes310801.pdf) on Real-Time granular synthesis processing. Currently the synthesizer is using files provided by the user and is constantly playing (the user changes the parameters of the synth to change its timbre).
